    "* What are the top-selling products and categories, and how do they perform across different seasons and customer demographics?\n",
    "* How do seasonal trends, holidays, and promotions impact sales, and are there specific times of the year when sales peak or dip?\n",
    "* Who are the top customer segments, and what are their purchasing preferences based on demographics like age, gender, and location?\n",
    "* How does pricing and discounting influence sales volume, and what is the average purchase amount for discounted vs. non-discounted items?\n",
    "* What are the trends in customer purchase frequency, loyalty, and preferred payment methods, and do these factors affect purchasing behavior?\n",
    "* How does customer satisfaction vary by product category, and are subscription models effective in retaining customers with higher purchase frequency?"
